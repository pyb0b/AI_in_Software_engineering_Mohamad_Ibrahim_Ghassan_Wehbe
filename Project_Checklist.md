# Project Checklist

## 1. Setup and Organization
- [x] Initialize the project using Poetry.
- [x] Create a modular `src` directory structure.
- [x] Install necessary dependencies using Poetry.
- [x] Ensure the environment runs the project with `poetry shell` or `poetry run`.

## 2. Documentation
- [x] Create a `README.md` file.
- [x] Add details about API endpoints:
  - Endpoint paths.
  - Expected input formats (e.g., JSON).
  - Example responses.
- [ ] Include Docker instructions (commands to build and run the app).
- [ ] Describe the MLOps aspects of the project (monitoring, logging, etc.).

## 3. Code Quality and Maintenance
- [x] Add type annotations to all functions and classes.
- [x] Set up a linter (e.g., `ruff`) to ensure clean and consistent code.
- [x] Use `mypy` for static type checking.
- [x] Write docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions.
- [x] Automate tasks (e.g., linting, testing, and training) using `PyInvoke`.

## 4. Testing
- [x] Write unit tests using `pytest` for:
  - Data loading and preprocessing functions.
  - Model training and evaluation functions.
  - API endpoints (integration tests).
- [x] Create a `tests` directory and organize test scripts.
- [x] Test the GUI functionality (e.g., `test_gui.py`).

## 5. Experiment Tracking
- [ ] Integrate MLflow for tracking experiments.
- [ ] Use the MLflow model registry to track trained models.

## 6. Containerization
- [ ] Write a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application.
- [ ] Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to manage services like Prometheus and MLflow.
- [ ] Test the application inside a Docker container.

## 7. Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)
- [ ] Set up a GitHub repository for your project.
- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions to automate:
  - Linting.
  - Testing.
  - Building Docker images.
- [ ] Use branches and Pull Requests (PRs) for collaborative development.

## 8. Monitoring and Alerting
- [ ] Integrate Prometheus for monitoring application metrics.
- [ ] Add custom metrics related to your recommender system.
- [ ] Set up alerting mechanisms for critical issues (e.g., API downtime).
